# Profile Image Upload Integration Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

Profile image uploads now use Supabase storage, matching the implementation in create_post_page.dart.

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **`lib/services/profile_image_upload_service.dart`**
A dedicated utility service for profile-related image uploads.

**Features:**
- ✅ Upload profile photos to `MediaContents/profiles/` folder
- ✅ Upload ID cards to `MediaContents/id-cards/` folder
- ✅ Generate unique filenames: `profile_{timestamp}_{randomId}.{ext}`
- ✅ File validation (size & type)
- ✅ Delete images from storage
- ✅ Returns public Supabase URLs

**Methods:**
```dart
uploadProfilePhoto(File imageFile) → Returns URL
uploadIdCard(File imageFile) → Returns URL
deleteImage(String imageUrl) → Deletes from Supabase
```

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **`lib/pages/profile/profile_setup_screen.dart`**

**Changes:**
- Imports ProfileImageUploadService
- Uploads images to Supabase BEFORE calling API
- Shows "Uploading images..." in loading dialog
- Passes URLs to API instead of File objects
- Auto-cleanup on failure

**Flow:**
```dart
_saveProfile() {
  1. Upload profile photo to Supabase → Get URL
  2. Upload ID card to Supabase → Get URL
  3. Call API with URLs
  4. If API fails → Delete uploaded images
}
```

### 2. **`lib/pages/profile/edit_profile_page.dart`**

**Changes:**
- Same improvements as profile_setup_screen.dart
- Better loading dialog UI
- Image cleanup on failure
- Logs upload progress

### 3. **`lib/controllers/student_profile_controller.dart`**

**Updated Method:**
```dart
updateProfileWithNewAPI({
  String? shortBio,
  String? identityNumber,
  String? academicEmail,
  File? profileImageFile,      // Legacy support
  File? idCardFile,            // Legacy support
  String? profileImageUrl,     // New: Supabase URL
  String? idCardUrl,           // New: Supabase URL
})
```

**Logic:**
- Prioritizes URLs over Files
- Falls back to base64 encoding if URL not provided
- Backward compatible with old code

- Database bloat
```

### **After (Supabase URLs)**
```
✅ No size limits (up to 10MB)
✅ Fast API requests (just URLs)
✅ Clean database (just URLs stored)
✅ CDN-ready for scaling
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Profile Photo Upload:**
1. Open profile setup/edit screen
2. Select a profile photo
3. Click "Save"
4. Watch console for:
   ```
   ProfileSetupScreen: Uploading profile photo to Supabase
   ProfileImageUploadService: Uploading as MediaContents/profiles/profile_xxx.jpg
   ProfileImageUploadService: Public URL: https://...
   Using Supabase profile photo URL: https://...
   ```

### **Test ID Card Upload:**
1. Select an ID card image
2. Click "Save"
3. Check console for upload logs
4. Verify both images uploaded

### **Test Error Handling:**
1. Turn off internet
2. Try uploading
3. Should show error and cleanup

## 🔐 Security

### **Storage Policies Required:**
Set these policies in Supabase Dashboard for `Kampus-kollab` bucket:

- **INSERT**: `true` (allow uploads)
- **SELECT**: `true` (allow read)
- **UPDATE**: `true` (allow updates)
- **DELETE**: `true` (allow deletes)

### **File Limits:**
- Maximum size: 10MB
- Allowed types: Images only (jpg, png, gif, webp)

## 📝 API Expectations

Your backend should now receive:

```json
{
  "shortBio": "Computer Science student",
  "identityNumber": "12345",
  "academicEmail": "student@university.edu",
  "profilePhotoUrl": "https://lethjhjytweagkbgumhu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Kampus-kollab/MediaContents/profiles/profile_xxx.jpg",
  "identityCardUrl": "https://lethjhjytweagkbgumhu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Kampus-kollab/MediaContents/id-cards/idcard_xxx.jpg"
}
```

**Note:** Backend should store these URLs as-is (not base64).

---

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Faster Performance**: No more encoding/decoding
2. **Larger Images**: No 4000 character limit
3. **Better UX**: Clear upload progress
4. **Scalable**: CDN-ready architecture
5. **Clean Code**: Reusable service across app
6. **Auto Cleanup**: Failed uploads don't waste storage

The same pattern can be used for:
- [ ] Project cover images
- [ ] Course materials
- [ ] Event photos
- [ ] Chat attachments

Just use `ProfileImageUploadService` or create similar services for other upload types!
